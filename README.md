# object-detection-using-ssd
this is detection algorithm which can detect nearly 20 objects like person,horses e.t.c, it uses ssd approach and a pretrained ssd model is being used here and all the weights of pretrained model of ssd are back propogated through a tensor vector in neural network we have implemented a code for running this ssd in real time detection.
